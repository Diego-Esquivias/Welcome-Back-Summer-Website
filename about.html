            <p>The design of our website is inspired by the tranquil beauty of a summer sky, with a color palette that evokes a gentle and soothing summer ambiance. To ensure the visual experience remains pleasant and easy on the eyes, we have chosen soft, pastel versions of summer colors. The background features a serene depiction of the summer sky, while warm yellow accents symbolize the sun. Complementing these hues, a subtle purple has been incorporated to enhance the overall aesthetic and create a harmonious balance.</p>
